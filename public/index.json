This is especially true if the specifications are constructed by preference elicitation from experts or by inferring specifications as a belief over logical formulas from examples. Quite often it might be impossible to simultaneously satisfy all the logical formulas in this collection, so it is desirable to best adhere to the entire distribution rather than individual formulas within its support.\nWhile it is easy to define the semantics of satisfaction of a single formula, in this work, we have identified four evaluation criteria that capture the semantics of satisfying a belief over logical formulas. These include the following:\n Most likely: Here only the formula with the highest probability in the belief distribution is satisfied, the other formulas are ignored. Maximum coverage: The largest set of unique formulas in the belief distribution is satisfied. Minimum regret: The hypothesis averaged satisfaction of the belief distribution is maximised. Chance constrained: The maximum probability of failure is determined by the user and the distribution is modified to only capture a set of formulas that have a cumulative probability larger than the failure probability.

A mission within such a game might be composed of multiple sub-quests that must be completed in order to complete that level. In this scenario, it is likely that your friend would comprehend what needs to be done in order to complete the mission well before he or she was actually able to play the game effectively. While learning from demonstrations, human apprentices can identify whether a task is executed correctly well before gaining expertise in that task. Most current approaches to learning from demonstration frame this problem as one of learning a reward function or policy within a Markov decision process setting; however, user specification of acceptable behaviors through reward functions and policies remains an open problem. Temporal logics are frequently used as a language for expressing desirable system behaviors, and can improve the interpretability of specifications if expressed as compositions of simpler templates.\nThe flexibility of LTL for specifying behaviors also represents a key challenge with regard to inference due to a large hypothesis space. We address this by restricting the hypothesis space to logical compositions of certain relevant behavior templates, thus encoding useful inductive biases. Another key challenge is the inherent ambiguity of the task where multiple formulas explain all the observed demonstrations equally well. To address that, we propose a Bayesian formulation of specification inference where the output is not a single formula, but a posterior distribution over formulas conditioned on the observed demonstrations, thus automatically representing the ambiguity and the uncertainty associated with it.\n","date":1560204902,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560204902,"objectID":"e488039b1f5f12d7574f869778a22ea8","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/ajshah/project/bsi/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T18:15:02-04:00","relpermalink":"/ajshah/project/bsi/","section":"project","summary":"We introduce a Bayesian formulation for specification inference that enables us to learn logical task specifications with very few examples.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Specification Inference","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Ankit Shah**","Shen Li","Julie Shah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"746c1c98da78ed168b4638e5d74ba9d3","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/ajshah/publication/shah2019puns/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T21:00:09.551355Z","relpermalink":"/ajshah/publication/shah2019puns/","section":"publication","summary":"Reward engineering is crucial to high performance in reinforcement learning systems. Prior research into reward design has largely focused on Markovian functions representing the reward. While there has been research into expressing non-Markovian rewards as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas, this has been limited to a single formula serving as the task specification. However, in many real-world applications, task specifications can only be expressed as a belief over LTL formulas. In this paper, we introduce planning with uncertain specifications (PUnS), a novel formulation that addresses the challenge posed by non-Markovian specifications expressed as beliefs over LTL formulas. We present four criteria that capture the semantics of satisfying a belief over specifications for different applications, and analyze the implications of these criteria within a synthetic domain. We demonstrate the existence of an equivalent markov decision process (MDP) for any instance of PUnS. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on the real-world task of setting a dinner table automatically with a robot that inferred task specifications from human demonstrations.","tags":null,"title":"Planning With Uncertain Specifications (PUnS)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph Kim","Christian Muise","**Ankit Shah**","Shubham Agarwal","Julie Shah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5c58e3de070899e00d660adf0ed6897b","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/ajshah/publication/kim-2019-ijcai/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T20:51:04.794104Z","relpermalink":"/ajshah/publication/kim-2019-ijcai/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Inference of Linear Temporal Logic Specifications for Contrastive Explanations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph Kim","Christian Muise","**Ankit Shah**","Shubham Agarwal","Julie Shah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e9ea94c940bf5ed27bf0583bca14230b","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/ajshah/publication/kim-2019-xaip/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T21:00:09.550823Z","relpermalink":"/ajshah/publication/kim-2019-xaip/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Inference of Temporal Specifications to Explain How Plans Differ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ankit Shah**","Pritish Kamath","Shen Li","Patrick Craven","Kevin Landers","Kevin Oden","Julie Shah"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0f8c4f59ad50810c217059d7513dd72b","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/ajshah/publication/shah-2019-ijrr/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T20:51:04.794299Z","relpermalink":"/ajshah/publication/shah-2019-ijrr/","section":"publication","summary":"When observing task demonstrations, human apprentices are able to identify whether a given task is executed correctly long before they gain expertise in actually performing that task.

In the field of human-robot interaction (HRI), with few widely accepted quantitative metrics, researchers often rely on Likert items and scales to evaluate their systems. However, there is a debate on what is the best statistical method to evaluate the differences between experimental treatments based on Likert item or scale responses. Likert responses are ordinal and not interval, meaning, the differences between consecutive responses to a Likert item are not equally spaced quantitatively. Hence, parametric tests like t-test, which require interval and normally distributed data, are often claimed to be statistically unsound in evaluating Likert response data. The statistical purist would use non-parametric tests, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate the differences in ordinal datasets; however, non-parametric tests sacrifice the sensitivity in detecting differences a more conservative specificity--or false positive rate. Finally, it is common practice in the field of HRI to sum up similar individual Likert items to form a Likert scale and use the t-test or ANOVA on the scale seeking the refuge of the central limit theorem. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the validity of the t-test vs. the Mann-Whitney U test for Likert items and scales. We conduct our investigation via Monte Carlo simulation to quantify sensitivity and specificity of the tests.","tags":null,"title":"Appraisal of Statistical Practices in HRI vis-a-vis the T-Test for Likert Items/Scales","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   We considered the task of installation of an interlinked set of cables in an aircraft fuselage.

Manipulation planning for multiple interlinked is inherently a mixed discrete and continuous problem. The cable shape and manipulator positions lie in a continuous state space, whereas the actions of clamping the cable to pre-defined clamp location, grasping or releasing a cable for a discrete state space. We tackle this in a hierarchical manner by defining a higher level task planner and a lower level motion planner.
