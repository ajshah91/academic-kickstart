      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD candidate in the Interactive Robotics Group at MIT advised by Prof. Julie Shah. My research interests lie in enabling robots to learn complex multi-step tasks from demonstrations. Towards that goal, I am trying to enable the use of formal logic formulas as intermediaries between the teacher and the learners of the task. I believe that transparency of objectives are a necessary condition for widespread deployment of autonomous robotic systems, and integrating formal logics with learned representations is an important step towards that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- #In particular, he is interested in enabling use of temporal logic formulas as an intermediary between the teacher and the learner.

#In the past he has also worked on manipulation planning for deformable objects for his SM thesis completed in 2016 at MIT. Prior to joining MIT, Ankit completed his B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) in 2013. --&gt;
