&lt;p&gt;Consider the task of setting a dinner table. It involves placing the appropriate serving utensils and silverware according to the dishes being served. Some of the objects need to be placed in a particular order as they might be stacked on top of each other or due to cultural traditions. Many real-world tasks demonstrate such temporal characteristics that can succinctly modeled with linear temporal logic (LTL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However defining sound and complete task specifications in LTL is non-trivial, and it remains desirable to allow robots to infer the task specifications through intuitive modalities like demonstrations, spoken instructions or corrections. Thus specifications for a task can at best be stated as a belief over candidate LTL formulas. An ideal learner would try to simultaneously satisfy as many of these candidate properties as possible while performing the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tackle this problem in this work, where we introduces a novel problem formulation for planning with uncertain specifications (PUnS). To do that we first identify four evaluation criteria than capture the semantics of satisfying a belief over LTL formulas. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most likely:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Here only the formula with the highest probability in the belief distribution is satisfied, the other formulas are ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maximum coverage:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The largest set of unique formulas in the belief distribution is satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minimum regret:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The hypothesis averaged satisfaction of the belief distribution is maximised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chance constrained:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The maximum probability of failure is determined by the user and the distribution is modified to only capture a set of formulas that have a cumulative probability larger than the failure probability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that the choice of evaluation criterion results in a trade-off between fliexibility in task execution and risk-aversion. Finally we also demonstrate that every instance of a PUnS problem can be compiled into an equivalent reward machine. This is an equivalent Markov decision process (MDP) for the original non-Markov PUnS problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate our technique on the table-setting task where the task specifications were inferred from 30 demonstrations, and the policy computed using the PUnS formulation sets the table with a very low error rate (0.001%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine showing a friend how to play your favorite quest-based video game. A mission within such a game might be composed of multiple sub-quests that must be completed in order to complete that level. In this scenario, it is likely that your friend would comprehend what needs to be done in order to complete the mission well before he or she was actually able to play the game effectively. While learning from demonstrations, human apprentices can identify whether a task is executed correctly well before gaining expertise in that task. Most current approaches to learning from demonstration frame this problem as one of learning a reward function or policy within a Markov decision process setting; however, user specification of acceptable behaviors through reward functions and policies remains an open problem. Temporal logics are frequently used as a language for expressing desirable system behaviors, and can improve the interpretability of specifications if expressed as compositions of simpler templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flexibility of LTL for specifying behaviors also represents a key challenge with regard to inference due to a large hypothesis space. We address this by restricting the hypothesis space to logical compositions of certain relevant behavior templates, thus encoding useful inductive biases. Another key challenge is the inherent ambiguity of the task where multiple formulas explain all the observed demonstrations equally well. To address that, we propose a Bayesian formulation of specification inference where the output is not a single formula, but a posterior distribution over formulas conditioned on the observed demonstrations, thus automatically representing the ambiguity and the uncertainty associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- We were able to successfully demonstrate the utility of specification inference on multiple domains. The first was a synthetic domain consisting of an agent moving in a 2D plain with points of interests and threats. The specifications included a set of points of interests to visit, the set of threats to avoid and a set of admissible orderings over the points of interest --&gt;

&lt;!-- The current repertoire of tasks that robots can plan for and can learn from demonstrations is quite limited.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Traditionally Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) has been viewed in the context of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). However this formulation of LfD restricts the types of task that robots can learn to the ones that are Markovian --&gt;

      <title>Manipulation planning for interlinked cables</title>

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We considered the task of installation of an interlinked set of cables in an aircraft fuselage. The cables in question are heavy harnesses of wiring that run along the length of the fuselage. The interlinks connecting the cables are fragile and can not bear the weight of the main cables; hence any attempt to manipulate the cables independently without considering these interlinks may result in damage to their electrical integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mmany promising approaches have been proposed towards manipulation and motion planning for a single cable with both ends manipulated, this problem requires a formulation that allows for planning with multiple cables with interlink constraints. Manipulation planning for multiple interlinked is inherently a mixed discrete and continuous problem. The cable shape and manipulator positions lie in a continuous state space, whereas the actions of clamping the cable to pre-defined clamp location, grasping or releasing a cable for a discrete state space. We tackle this in a hierarchical manner by defining a higher level task planner and a lower level motion planner. We propose the problem formulation for the higher level task planner and propose a prototype planner to generate satisficing solutions to the task planning problem.&lt;/p&gt;
