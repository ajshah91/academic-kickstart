Teach an actual robot to set a dinner table from your home. The Interactive Robotics Group at MIT is seeking participants for a robot training experiment. You will be training an actual UR-10 robot located in our lab remotely from your home/office. You will get a chance to work with a robotic platform using state-of-the-art learning algorithms for robotics.

The experiment will run for 90 minutes, and you will receive a check of $15 for completing the experiment (subject to [tax regulation](http://couhes.mit.edu/guidelines/paymentcosts)). We are currently enrolling only US based participants and hope to expand the study soon.

Prerequisites:

1. Zoom desktop client (We cannot support mobile or tablet apps).
2. Stable internet connection to support a video call.

You can book a session [here](http://robot-training.youcanbookme.com). For any additional information please contact Ankit Shah at   <mailto:ajshah@mit.edu>
