abstract: "Defining sound and complete specifications for robots using formal languages is challenging, while learning formal specifications directly from demonstrations can lead to over-constrained task policies. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian interactive robot training framework that allows the robot to learn from both demonstrations provided by a teacher, and that teacher's assessments of the robot's task executions. We also present an active learning approach -- inspired by uncertainty sampling -- to identify the task execution with the most uncertain degree of acceptability. We demonstrate that active learning within our framework identifies a teacher's intended task specification to a greater degree of similarity when compared with an approach that learns purely from demonstrations. Finally, we also conduct a user-study that demonstrates the efficacy of our active learning framework in learning a table-setting task from a human teacher."
