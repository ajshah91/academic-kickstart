abstract: "Reward engineering is crucial to high performance
in reinforcement learning systems. Prior research into reward
design has largely focused on Markovian functions representing
the reward. While there has been research into expressing non-
Markovian rewards as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas, this
has been limited to a single formula serving as the task speci-
fication. However, in many real-world applications, task specifi-
cations can only be expressed as a belief over LTL formulas. In
this paper, we introduce planning with uncertain specifications
(PUnS), a novel formulation that addresses the challenge posed
by non-Markovian specifications expressed as beliefs over LTL
formulas. We present four criteria that capture the semantics of
satisfying a belief over specifications for different applications,
and analyze the implications of these criteria within a synthetic
domain. We demonstrate the existence of an equivalent markov
decision process (MDP) for any instance of PUnS."
